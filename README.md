# WeatherPy Analysis
For this project we were tasked with assisting a company in making a travel planning app, after its development we were asked to take it the next level by adding maps to help visualize what your vacation plan would look like

# Results
Unfortunately technology is not perfect. Despite the code being right we could not make a figure appeare within the jupyter notebook. The API was supposed to draw in information from user input and display it for them. We were able to create the input, but asking for a fig was the final straw for jupyter. Thankfully our user's understand and gave us a pat on the back for trying our best!! They will have to use the google maps app to get around their lovely trip in Portugal.
